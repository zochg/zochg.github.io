# Summary

I believe that I am qualified for this position because I have deep, personal experience working abroad with people in developing countries and can recognize and evaluate the problems facing them and their communities. Because of this, I feel that I can help the organization to further meet its goals towards creating a productive, equitable, and empowering environment for people across the globe.

A guiding principle of my life has been from John F Kennedy. As he so eloquently said, 

> And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.
